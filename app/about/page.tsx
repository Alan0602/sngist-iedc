          Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell (IEDC-SNGIST),
          earlier known as EDC@SNGIST, was established in the year of 2014. It
          was formed with the aim of creating an eco-system, where students as
          well as teachers are encouraged and supported to develop innovative
          products, register start-ups, attain patents etc. Also activities like
          technical workshops, trainings, industrial visits, project and idea
          contests etc. are organised on a regular basis, by which students and
          faculty members are able to apply their technical capabilities and
          convert them into socially relevant products. IEDC-SNGIST was
          registered in Directorate of Industries and Commerce (DIC) (Reg. No.
          EDC/EKLM/ 07/14). In 2015 it was recognized as an approved IEDC by
          Kerala Start-up Mission earlier known as Technopark â€“ Technology
          Business Incubator (Reg. No. T-TBI/2014-15/IEDC/SNGIST). SNGIST signed
          an MoU with KITCO Ltd in March 2016, with the aim of working together
          to promote entrepreneurial activities.
