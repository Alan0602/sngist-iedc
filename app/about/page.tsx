                trainings, industrial visits, project and idea contests etc. are
                organised on a regular basis, by which students and faculty
                members are able to apply their technical capabilities and
                convert them into socially relevant products. IEDC-SNGIST was
                registered in Directorate of Industries and Commerce (DIC) (Reg.
                No. EDC/EKLM/ 07/14). In 2015 it was recognized as an approved
